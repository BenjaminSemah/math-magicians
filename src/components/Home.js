        Having some math knowledge is always useful.
        If you think about it, most of us use it on a
        daily basis — whether we are measuring something,
        sorting, noticing patterns, making comparisons or
        recognizing shapes. Of course, we do not necessarily
        use complex formulas, but we do need some basic math
        skills for all these activities.

        When it comes to children, it is crucial to teach them
        about the importance of problem solving. We all know
        that for some kids there are few words scarier than
        “math”. But we can influence their thinking by
        incorporating math in enjoyable activities and
        by having a positive attitude towards it.
